//: ## Deinitialization
//:
//: A deinitializer is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated.
//:
//: You write deinitializers with the deinit keyword, similar to how initializers are written with the init keyword.
//:
//: ----
//: ### How Deinitialization Works
//:
//: Swift automatically deallocates your instances when they are no longer needed, to free up resources
//:
//: Class definitions can have at most one deinitializer per class.
//:
//: Deinitializers are called automatically, just before instance deallocation takes place.
//:
//: A deinitializer can access all properties of the instance it is called on and can modify its behavior based on those properties.
