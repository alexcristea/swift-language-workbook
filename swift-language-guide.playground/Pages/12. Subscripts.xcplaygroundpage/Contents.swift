//: ## Subscripts
//:
//: Classes, structures, and enumerations can define subscripts, which are shortcuts for accessing the member elements of a collection, list, or sequence.
//:
//: You use subscripts to set and retrieve values by index without needing separate methods for setting and retrieval.
//:
//: ----
//: ### Subscript Syntax
//:
//: Subscripts enable you to query instances of a type by writing one or more values in square brackets after the instance name.
//:
//: You write subscript definitions with the subscript keyword, and specify one or more input parameters and a return type, in the same way as instance methods.

//: ----
//: ### Subscript Usage
//:
//: Subscripts are typically used as a shortcut for accessing the member elements in a collection, list, or sequence.

//: ----
//: ### Subscript Options
//:
//: Subscripts can take any number of input parameters, and these input parameters can be of any type.
//:
//: Subscripts can also return any type.
//:
//: Subscripts can use variable parameters and variadic parameters, but cannot use in-out parameters or provide default parameter values.
//:
//: A class or structure can provide as many subscript implementations as it needs.
